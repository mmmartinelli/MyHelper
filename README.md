This repository helps me save time when processing some data!

A nuget package project focused on reducing data processing concerns, allowing developers to focus solely on the business logic of their applications.

## ðŸª› Features

## ðŸ†• Getting started

MyHelper is installed from NuGet

```bash
dotnet add package MyHelper

The simplest way to set up MyHelper is using the static class of the desired resource:

```csharp
using MyHelper;
```
